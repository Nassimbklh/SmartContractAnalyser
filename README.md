# Smart Contract Analyzer - Installation and Testing Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Slither Analyzer to the Backend

Slither is a static analyzer for Solidity smart contracts. It was missing from the backend container, which prevented static analysis of smart contracts. I've added it to the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Install Slither for smart contract static analysis
RUN pip install slither-analyzer
```

## Testing the Changes

### 1. Rebuild the Backend Container

After making changes to the Dockerfile, you need to rebuild the backend container:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2. Verify Slither Installation

Once the container is running, you can verify that Slither is installed by:

1. Analyzing a smart contract through the web interface
2. Checking the backend logs for Slither analysis output:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend | grep "Slither analysis"
   ```
   You should see messages like "Running Slither analysis..." and "Slither analysis completed successfully" instead of errors.

### 3. Check OpenAI Quota

As mentioned in the issue description, GPT-4 is blocked, which is preventing advanced analysis and attack generation. To fix this:

1. Go to the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)
2. Check if you have remaining quota or if you need to add a payment method to recharge
3. Ensure your API key in the `.env` file is valid and has access to GPT-4

## Expected Results

After implementing these changes and ensuring your OpenAI quota is sufficient:

1. The application should be able to perform static analysis using Slither
2. GPT-4 should be available for advanced analysis and attack generation
3. The final report should correctly identify vulnerable contracts as "KO" instead of incorrectly showing "OK"

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the backend logs for any errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend
   ```

2. Verify that the Slither command is available in the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend which slither
   ```
   This should return a path like `/usr/local/bin/slither`

3. If OpenAI API calls are still failing, check your API key and quota in the OpenAI dashboard
